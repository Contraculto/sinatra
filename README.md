Collaborative music for small environments.

This is a project I made with a friend several years ago, looking for a fun way to play music in the office that would allow everyone to be happy about it.

It served it's purpose well for a long time, but I'n now looking to re-do it with several improvements, the main one being migrating from php & mysql to node and some kind of nosql, so as to make it easier to deploy.

The old code can be found in the /old_php_version directory and requires Apache, MySQL, Music Player Daemon and MPC, the MPD CLI client. Feel free to use or modify it if you like, but bear in mind the code kind of sucks.
